              <p>
                As a Senior Designer and UX Manager, I believe that exceptional design emerges 
                from the intersection of deep user empathy, strategic thinking, and meticulous 
                craftsmanship. My approach is rooted in Swiss design principlesâ€”clarity, 
                functionality, and purposeful simplicity.

              <p>
                Throughout my career at organizations like Tech Mahindra and Minacs, I've led 
                cross-functional teams in delivering digital experiences that not only meet 
                business objectives but fundamentally improve people's lives.
